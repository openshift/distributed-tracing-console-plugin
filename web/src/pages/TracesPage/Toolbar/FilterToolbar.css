/*
 * Hide the placeholder div used for customChipGroupContent.
 *
 * In PatternFly 5, customChipGroupContent is rendered as a sibling to chip groups
 * inside the toolbar content area. We must hide only this specific element,
 * NOT its parent (which would also hide the chips).
 *
 * Note: PatternFly 6 uses customLabelGroupContent with a different DOM structure
 * where the parent can be safely hidden. See main branch for PF6 approach.
